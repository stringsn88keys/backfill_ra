# backfill_ra
Process the `activities.csv` from Strava back into RunningAhead.com.

Note: I added a "Duration" column to the csv manually before I went the scripting route and decided to use it.

## How to run
Add a `.config` file with:

```
    EMAIL='youremail@example.com'
    PASSWORD='P@55w0rd'
```
